AI 4 Health Alzheimers Classification

https://ai4alzheimers.devpost.com/

Completed Dec 30, 2025.  I was not eligible to submit as I am not a student.
I first attempted to do a neural network, but then decided to do SVM first.

Here is the model classification report for the SVM I made (on the test.parquet):
precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.98      0.97      0.98       172
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00        15
           2       0.98      0.99      0.99       634
           3       0.99      0.97      0.98       459

    accuracy                           0.98      1280
   macro avg       0.99      0.98      0.99      1280
weighted avg       0.98      0.98      0.98      1280

I was happy with this result!
